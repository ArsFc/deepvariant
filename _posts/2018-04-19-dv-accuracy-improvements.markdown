description: "This post covers the release of DeepVariant v0.6, which includes some major accuracy improvements. We describe how we train DeepVariant, and how we were able to improve DeepVariant's accuracy for two common sequencing scenarios, whole exome sequencing and polymerase chain reaction sequencing, simply by adding representative data into DeepVariant's training process."
